  <h1>📘 Calls vs. Puts – In Plain English</h1>

  <p>If you’re new to options trading, the words “call” and “put” can sound like secret code. This guide explains what they really mean—without the jargon.</p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>💵 What’s a Put?</h2>
    <p><strong>A put is a way to get paid to wait for a discount.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s say you like a stock, but you only want to buy it if it drops to $100.<br />
      You agree: “If it drops to $100, I’ll buy it.”<br />
      In return, someone <strong>pays you cash right now</strong> for that promise.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the stock doesn’t drop → you keep the cash ✅</li>
      <li>If it does → you buy it at the discount you wanted ✅</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is called “selling a put,” but think of it like:<br />
      <em>“I’ll buy your stock if it gets cheaper—pay me now just in case.”</em>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>📦 What’s a Call?</h2>
    <p><strong>A call is a way to get paid while waiting to sell.</strong></p>
    <p>
      You already own a stock. You’re willing to sell it if it hits $120.<br />
      So you say: “If it hits $120, I’ll sell it.”<br />
      Someone <strong>pays you now</strong> for that agreement.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If it never hits $120 → you keep your stock and the cash ✅</li>
      <li>If it does → you sell at a profit—and still keep the cash ✅</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is called “selling a call,” but it really means:<br />
      <em>“I’ll sell my stock later—pay me now to lock in the price.”</em>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>🔁 What’s the Strategy?</h2>
    <p>At WhaleWatch, we teach people how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sell puts</strong> to get paid while waiting to buy a stock at a discount</li>
      <li><strong>Sell calls</strong> to get paid again while waiting to sell it for a profit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This repeatable income strategy is called <strong>“premium harvesting.”</strong><br />
      We just made it human.
