  <h2>ðŸŒ¾ Our Strategy: Premium Harvesting</h2>
  <p>
    This strategy is formally known as the <strong>cash-secured put and covered call cycle</strong>.
    But around here, we call it <strong>premium harvesting</strong> â€” because you're collecting income every step of the way.
  </p>
  <p>Hereâ€™s how it works, step by step:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a stock you'd be happy to own (especially if whales are trading it).</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sell a put option. You get paid to wait â€” and only buy the stock if it drops to your target price.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you get the shares, sell a call option above your cost. Thatâ€™s more cash in your pocket.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Repeat the process. You earn premiums while reducing your risk over time.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Youâ€™re not chasing stocks. Youâ€™re harvesting income â€” on your terms.
