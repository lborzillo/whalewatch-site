      <h2>Why Premium Harvesting Works</h2>
      <p>Premium harvesting isn’t about predicting the next big move in the market. It’s about using volatility and timing to collect premium week after week — with careful risk management. You’re farming consistent income, not chasing big wins.</p>
      
      <h2>The WhaleWatch Approach</h2>
      <p>We track the whales and harvest the premium. By observing big institutional trades, we identify where volatility is spiking. Then, we sell options at premium spots, systematically collecting cash in a repeatable, low-risk way.</p>
      
      <h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
      <p>Premium harvesting is for traders who prefer consistency over speculation. It’s for those who want a structured income from their trades, rather than relying on market guessing games.</p>
